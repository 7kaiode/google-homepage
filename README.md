This is my first ever project to anything about code and I have remade the google homepage. Although it isn't the cleanest and there is a lot more to learn, this was a fun thing to put some of what I learned to work. 

Some of the skills/lessons I put to work here were: 
1. Using classes and ID's to style elements
2. Setting up buttons and input text fields, although they have no functions
3. Setting up images and resizing them
4. Learning how to use Google searches for help and code when I ran into issues

Overall, I think I have learned what I can do and can't do and what I need to improve on!
